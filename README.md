## 🧑‍💻 About the Project

This project is a **fork** of the original work by **[joaogonp](https://github.com/joaogonp)**.

The original code was adapted and streamlined to focus exclusively on the world's most famous secret agent. Most of the logical structure and the server-side configuration base were developed by João, to whom I give full credit for sharing the base project with the community.
